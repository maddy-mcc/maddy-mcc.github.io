   	  <h1 class="position"> Family Friendly Island! </h1>
   	  
   	  <p>Getting to Hilton Head Island is easy breezy and is as enjoyable as the stay!
   	   When flying to HHI, there is the HHI airport which lands you right on the island. 
   	   Another airport is the <a href="https://savannahairport.com">Savannah airport</a> which takes you to Savannah, Georgia. 
   	   From there you can explore the beautiful city of Savannah before traveling over 
   	   the bridge onto HHI! If you prefer traveling by car, driving into South Carolina 
   	   and over the bridge onto the island is a magical experience for the whole family!</p>
