   	  <p>The beautiful island of Hilton Head has so many fun and exciting 
   	  attractions for the whole family! From shopping in <a href="http://www.welcometosheltercove.com">Shelter Cove's</a>
   	  outdoor mall to lounging on Colignyâ€™s clear beaches there is always something to do on the island. 
   	  From lounging on the beach you can book a time to go <a href="http://www.seamonkeyshhi.com">jet skiing</a> 
   	  on the deep blue waters surrounding the shoe shaped island. While jet 
   	  skiing you can bump into the bottlenose dolphins that spend their time 
   	  following the food that moves with the tides around Hilton Head. 
   	  To get a closer look at the friendly cute dolphins, there are <a href="https://www.seapines.com/recreation/harbour-town/cruises-and-boat-tours.aspx">dolphin tours</a>
   	  right in Harbour Town where you will learn all about the local dolphins 
   	  of HHI. After the dolphin tour, Harbour town offers many cute stores and 
   	  restaurants to eat after climbing up the famous Harbour town lighthouse!
   	   The family will love all that Hilton Head has to offer!</p>
