   	  <p>The beautiful island of Hilton Head was discovered in 1663 by captain Willam 
   	  Hilton who originally claimed the island for England. WIlliam was greeted by 
   	  Spanish-speaking Indians from the Yemassee tribe and extraordinary nine feet 
   	  high sea shell rings that are still a mystery today of where they came from. 
   	  By 1940, Hilton Island was recognized by a group of timbermen who saw the great 
   	  potential with the tall, straight pines and the lumber it could produce that would 
   	  be used for a variety of things. In 1956, Charles Fraser was the one that 
   	  recognized that HHI was more than just a place full of timber. He was the one 
   	  that with the vision of building a resort on this beautiful island. He was also 
   	  the one that constructed the bridge to the mainland for people to get onto the 
   	  island to appreciate the beauty and relax at the resort. The Sea Pines Plantation 
   	  became the model for modern resorts around the world. Hilton Head is known for its 
   	  beautiful plantations and gorgeous beaches that are enjoyed by people from all over!  </p>
